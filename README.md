This project is made to be evaluated in the final instance of module 6, to Fronted Development career, dictated by the institution ADA. This project is based on the creation of a web page of consultation or search of movies, both the latest releases, as well as the classics of always.

## Web page sections

- **HEADER:** In this section you can find the navigation bar of the website. There you can use the buttons to consult the most popular movies, or the latest releases. There is also a 'Search' button that will allow you to enter a name and it will show you all the matches found on the page.
- **MAIN SECTION:** Here you will find a carousel of the most popular movies, with access to their details, and a trailer of this one. In addition to two lists that classify the movies between the most popular, and the best rated.
- **CARD DETAIL:** In these cards are presented the details of each movie that we want to consult and a button that will allow us to view a trailer of the same.
